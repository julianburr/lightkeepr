## Create a new account

Getting started with Lightkeepr is easy and quick. To create a new account, go to https://www.lightkeepr.io/auth/sign-up and choose your login method of choice by either clicking on one of the third party providers or clicking on "Sign up with Email" and entering your email address and the password you want to use.

## Complete your profile

After signing up, you'll be asked to complete your personal profile by adding a name. This will make it easier for other team members to easily identify you later. You can always change your name in the profile settings in the app at any time.

## Set up a team

Unless you've already been invited to another team, the next step will be to create one. Teams are used to group projects and to get all people who work on these together. You can read more on teams [here](./features/teams).

## Invite other team members

That's it, you are ready to go ðŸŽ‰

To invite other team members to this project, you can go "Users" in the left-hand menu and click on "Invite new user". This will open a screen that let's you enter the email address of the member you want to invite, and a select for the role you want to assign to them. Read more about the roles [here](./features/teams#user-roles).

## Create your first project

To create your first project, simply click on the "Add a new project" in the team overview. Projects are a way to group all related Lighthouse reports. You can read more [here](./features/projects). In general it likely makes sense to have different projects for the different kinds of websites and apps you have in your organisation.

Give your project a name so everyone in your team knows what they are looking at. You can also optionally set up target scores. If any of the scores in a report are below their targets, the report will be marked as "failed". Read more on targets and the manual approval process [here](./features/projects#project-targets).

## Record reports for your new project

Now that everything is set up, you can start recording reports to the project to just created. To do so, use any of the Lightkeepr packages and use the project specific authentication token.

We summarised some example setups on how to record reports [here](./features/reports#how-to-record-reports).
