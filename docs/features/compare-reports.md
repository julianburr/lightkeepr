## How does Lightkeepr compare reports?

### Audit scores

The "compare" functionality in Lightkeepr works by taking both Lighthouse reports (e.g. report instances of the same report from different runs) and check for differences in scores in any of the audits. In the Lightkeepr UI you can then find the audits that do differ and compare them, to quickly find potential causes for the differences.

### Overview

Lightkeepr also takes the metrices from the report overviews and compares the values of those metrices. This can be helpful to see concrete digressions e.g. in specific parts of the page load or increases in network traffic directly, which again can point you to the underlying causes for differences.
